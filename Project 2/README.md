XYZ Company, a rapidly expanding enterprise based in Eastern Sri Lanka, specializes in the selling and buying of food items primarily managed from its headquarters. The company is now planning to establish a new local branch, necessitating the design of a separate network for the branch. As part of this initiative, the company seeks young IT graduates to undertake the network design task.

The branch network is required to operate independently from the headquarters and must adhere to the following specifications:

- Utilization of one router and one switch, both Cisco products.
- Establishment of three departments (Admin/IT, Finance/HR, and Customer Service/Reception), each assigned to different VLANs.
- Provision of wireless networks in each department for user connectivity.
- Configuration for automatic IPv4 address assignment for host devices.
- Implementation of inter-departmental communication capabilities.

Considering the provided base network address of 192.168.1.0 by the ISP, the designated network engineer is tasked with designing and implementing a network infrastructure that fulfills these requirements effectively.
