This project involves designing a network in Cisco Packet Tracer to establish connectivity between the ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments. The main objectives include:

- Setting up a minimum of two PCs in each department.
- Configuring switches and routers for optimal network connectivity.
- Assigning appropriate IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways using the provided network address (192.168.40.0).
- Establishing physical connections between devices using suitable cables.
- Verifying connectivity by testing the ability of PCs in the DELIVERY department to ping PCs in the ACCOUNTS department.

The designed network aims to facilitate seamless communication between the specified departments, fostering efficient information exchange and collaboration within the organization.
